I will implement the DOM (Document Object Model) in this Challenge. ⚠️ **I am trying to work on it by myself without looking at the completed project.

How it works: When the webpage is refreshed, the two dice will change. The title will also update to match the result of the two dice.


This challenge is part of one section in the course The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu
